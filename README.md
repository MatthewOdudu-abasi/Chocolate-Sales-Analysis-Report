## 🔁 Summary of Process
1. **Data Preprocessing in Excel**:
   - Removed duplicates and null records
   - Standardized country and product names
   - Verified date sequences and data types
   - Cleaned and validated geocodable data (e.g., corrected country spellings)

2. **Analysis in Power BI**:
   - Designed an interactive dashboard
   - Filtered insights by month, product, region, and salesperson
   - Created comparative visuals for boxes shipped, monthly patterns, and best/worst performers

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Eliminated empty rows in key columns (Salesperson, Product)
- Ensured "Boxes Shipped" was a numeric field across all records
- Aligned inconsistent product and country labeling
- Checked that monthly sales entries followed correct order (Jan–Aug)

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Top Product**: Dark Bites (9.8K boxes sold)
- **Top Salesperson**: Karlen McCaffrey (10K boxes sold)
- **Peak Month**: June (163K total boxes shipped)
- **Top Country**: Australia (33K boxes), followed by Canada (31K)
- **Total Sales**: Across all countries and products, over 800K boxes shipped

---

## 🔍 Observations
- Sales dipped in February but surged in June, suggesting seasonality
- Product sales were relatively balanced across the top 5 chocolates
- Female sales reps performed strongly, with several tied near the top
- Canada, UK, and India had near-identical performance levels
- Salesforce performance was evenly distributed across high performers

---

## ✅ Recommendations
1. **Expand Popular Product Lines**  
   Focus marketing efforts and production around Dark Bites with limited-edition variations or bundled combos.

2. **Recognize and Motivate Top Performers**  
   Offer rewards or mentorship opportunities to high-sellers like Karlen McCaffrey and Beverie Moffet.

3. **Investigate Seasonal Trends**  
   Study why February underperforms—inventory, holidays, weather, or logistics—and plan accordingly.

4. **Strengthen Underperforming Regions**  
   Boost visibility and distribution efforts in the U.S. and India, where potential remains untapped.

5. **Align Launches with Peak Months**  
   With June seeing high demand, introduce new products or promotions during that cycle.

6. **Forecasting and Automation**  
   Develop predictive sales models based on month-to-month patterns for smarter inventory and logistics planning.
